Cluster Analysis of Customers: Marketing Segmentation and Insights 

1. Introduction

It is difficult for us to implement different strategies for the customers as they have different attributes and shopping patterns. Therefore, we need to find a way to target specific segments of customers and implement different strategies to maximize sales. In this case, we aim to set up a model to cluster customers into different segments, and then find patterns in their purchasing behaviours, so that we can suggest suitable marketing strategies (products/promotions/places) to target each segment.

2. General Insights   

1) Age: The young age customers in our case usually have lower incomes and fewer children because of their age. It is more likely for older customers who worked for years to have higher incomes and raise children. This group of young, relatively poor customers and mostly with no children, are the main customers for the company’s gold, fish, fruits and sweet products. Besides, they visit the company’s website more often and seldom shop through catalogs. Therefore generally to target this type of customer, the promotion on the company's website should focus on catering to the shopping needs of the young customers. For example, gold, fish, fruits and sweet products' promotion should be well designed on the website.
2) Income: Most of the high-income customers spent most of their money on wines and meat products. And they visit the company’s website on a low frequency. However, it is more likely for them to buy products through a catalog. So, in order to target high-income customers, the company can promote different product mixes of wines and meats through catalog, especially meat which is bought in large amounts for high-income customers. And other types of products can be left out to save on promotion costs.
3) Children: Another group of customers are those who have 2 to 3 children. It is natural that these customers are relatively older. But their incomes vary. They visit the company’s website on a relatively high frequency and purchase wines, meat and gold.

3. Marketing Strategies for Each Segment

Cluster 1 (Average Youngsters):
Cluster 1 is mainly average youngsters whose income levels are not high and who have one or less than one child. For the product strategy, we could promote products including fish, fruits and gold to them. At the same time, we would leave out promoting wines to this group to save cost. As for the distribution strategy, we could focus on their store and website purchases, just as cluster 2 and 4 considering that their patterns are similar. As for the promotion strategy, we can create content and promotion targeting this group on the website, because they visit the website most frequently. For example, discounts on Gold, Fish or fruit products can be highlighted on the website.
Cluster 2 (The Young Affluents):
Cluster 2 is those young affluent. They already achieved high income at a young age. For product strategy, we could promote wines and meat to them, while leaving out other products. As for distribution strategy, we could occasionally send our product catalogs to them, as they are more likely than other clusters to purchase by using catalogs in procurement. To target their needs, the product mix in the catalog should be mainly wines and meat. As for the promotion strategy, we could use fewer resources to create promotions on our website targeting this group, as they are less likely to visit our website.
Cluster 3 (The Older Affluents):
Cluster 3 is mainly the elder affluent. The company can mostly promote wines to them. And same with cluster 2, the catalog promotion should be used for this cluster. To target their needs, the product mix in the catalog should be mainly wines and meat. And there is no need for a specific promotion campaign on the website for this cluster.
Cluster 2 (Senior Parents):
Cluster 4 would be parents who have 2-3 children. For product strategy, we could frequently promote wines to them. As for the distribution strategy, we could use the same strategy used on the Youngsters. And since these parents visit the company’s website quite often, the website promotion materials should also cater to their needs. For example, discounts on some children-used products or products related to parenting should be included on the website.
