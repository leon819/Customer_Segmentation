Cluster Analysis of Customers: Marketing Segmentation and Insights 

1. Introduction 
It is difficult for us to implement different strategies for the customers as they have different attributes and shopping patterns. Therefore, we need to find a way to target specific segments of customers and implement different strategies to maximize sales. In this case, we aim to set up a model to cluster customers into different segments, and then find patterns in their purchasing behaviours, so that we can suggest suitable marketing strategies (products/promotions/places) to target each segment.
